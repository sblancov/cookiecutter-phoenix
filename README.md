# Cookiecutter Phoenix

The aim of this project is to create a template which I can use to create every phoenix project without pain.

Read documentation about [technology](./docs/technology.md) to know how this is done.

## Usage

Just execute:

    cookiecutter gh:sblancov/cookiecutter-phoenix

And then you have to change your directory to go into the project directory called as you have picked.

And you can run a development environment executing:

    make up

It uses docker behind the scenes so you need to install it. You can stop it executing:

    make down

Take a look in makefile to know what you can do easily.

Happy coding!
